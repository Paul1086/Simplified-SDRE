# Simplified SDRE

SDRE is basically a sub-optimal algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to eliminate the sub-optimality of the algorithm and proposed "Simplified SDRE" for both regulation and tracking problems. Simplified SDRE was verified by implementing it in wind energy conversion systems and robotic hands. Please go through the following papers to know the details about existing SDRE and our proposed Simplified SDRE.
